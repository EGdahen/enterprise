## States and Variations

The Toolbar Control itself can be enabled or disabled.

Each [Button](https://soho.infor.com/index.php?p=component/buttons) or [Text Input Field](https://soho.infor.com/index.php?p=component/text-input-field) in the Toolbar will inherit the usual states that can be expected for those controls.

## Responsive Guidelines

When there are too many buttons, inputs, or other items present on the toolbar to fit on one line, items that would normally wrap to a second line are hidden. The hidden items will move to an overflow [action button.](https://soho.infor.com/index.php?p=component/actions-menu-button)
