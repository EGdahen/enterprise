## Code Example

The home page component needs js for its layout mechanism. Call the `.homepage()` plugin on the prescribed structure. The plugin will take care on resize that everything is laid out in the best order and use of space it can be.

See also the card/widget examples [View Example]( ../components/cards) for widget structure.

```html

<div class="homepage page-container scrollable" data-columns="3">
  <div class="content">

    <div class="widget triple-width">
    ...
    </div>

    <div class="widget">
    ...
    </div>

    <div class="widget">
    ...
    </div>

  </div>
</div>


```
