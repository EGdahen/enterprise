## Behavior Guidelines

-   The link shows a color change underneath on hover and a border around on focus.

## Code Example

### Hyperlinks

A Hyperlink uses a standard anchor tag element and styles it with pure css. No JS is needed for this component. Use theÂ normal attributes and events of a standard anchor tag (click, focus ect). Note that the disabled attribute is NOT valid html so should be avoided, however it's included for backwards compatibility and some use cases. Normally a disabled link would be a label/text. There is alternate classes for visited links and Back/Forward Links.

```html

<a class="hyperlink" href="#">More Information Hyperlink</a>


```
