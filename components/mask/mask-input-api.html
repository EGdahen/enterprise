      the pattern that is used by the mask for determining input to keep or throw out.
 Arrays of strings representing individual characters, and regex matching individual characters, is the perferred way of supplying a pattern.
 For some `settings.process` types (date/time/number), a function that dynamically generates a mask is automatically used.
 It's also possible to define a custom mask function and supply it here. The legacy string style is also supported.
