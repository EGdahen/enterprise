    <h2>Notes About How This Test Works</h2>
    <p>
      There are three items in the Navigation Menu on this test:
      <br>
      <br>
      1. <b>Home</b>: Working link with no accordion panes beneath.  Clicking it anywhere should simply open the link.
      <br>
      2. <b>Articles</b>: Working link with accordion panes beneath.  Clicking the "link" area should take activate the link.  Clicking the expander (+/-) should expand/collapse the accordion pane.
      <br>
      3. <b>Components</b>: Inactive link with accordion panes beneath.  Clicking anywhere on this header will expand/collapse the accordion pane.
      <br>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The user will know that a link "worked" if an alert dialog is triggered when the link is clicked.
