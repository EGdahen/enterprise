## 4.2.1 - Minor Release
Release Date: Approx 1-2 Weeks

### Key New Features

* Hello

### Breaking Changes
* 2016-09-16 - Busy Indicator - Changed the **delay** setting to **displayDelay**.  When defining settings inside of the HTML markup using the _data-options_ attribute, using "delay" in some cases would cause settings on different Soho Controls that were named "delay" to conflict, causing them both to be the same number.  Changing the name of property on the more transient Busy Indicator fixed the bug, but it does cause a breaking change.  This was completely changed and there was no deprecation, in order to prevent issues with "delay" from occuring. (see SOHO-2951)

* Bubble Chart
* Positive/Negative Chart
* Datagrid Export to XLS
* Datagrid Icon Buttons
* Datagrid Formatters for Class/ Content Visible
* Datagrid Rendering Performance Boost

### Breaking Changes
* 2016-09-21 - Reverted Changes for external SVG files. For reasons on SOHO-3932 external svg files cannot be supported. We reverted this change back. Please using inline svg's in the page.
* 2016-09-16 - tabs afteractive renamed to afteractived for consistency
* 2016-08-16 - Popupmenu classes were not mutually exclusive now both the is-selectable and has-icons class add extra left padding. It may be needed to remove has-icons if you have a selectable menu and no actual row icons or you might end up with extra space.
* 2016-08-10 - Date and TimePicker - The forceHourMode option was not used in timepicker so was removed. In Datepicker it had a buggy effect. If used it can be removed from your markup. Use the timeFormat option to control 24h vs 12h format.
* 2016-07-14 - Changed app menu so its less backwards compatible. Anyone that has written their app menu markup to sit next to the hamburger button in the header; will need to move that app menu markup to the body in their code manually. So the structure should be icons -> app menu -> page container.
* 2016-07-01 - Changed css table-layout of datagrid. This means that the widths set in columns now work more accurately. In examples previously some of the widths set did not work. Now they do. So this may require update default column widths in grids you use. If you leave width out it will auto size to content as previously.
* 2016-06-14 - Changed font weight of placeholder text to normal (from lighter)
* 2016-06-01 - Wizard now longer has disabled style as this conflicts with "not completed" style. If a situation arises where a wizard tab cannot be clicked, use error messages to indicate.
* 2016-06-01 - Updated to jQuery 3.0 (not really totally required/breaking)
* 2016-06-01 - Renamed (not frequently used) .sort plugin to .arrange.

### Ui Changes
* 2016-08-30 - http://usmvvwdev53:421/tests/header - Shows a number of header options we added
* 2016-08-24 - Changed border color from graphite02 to graphite03 (this was a mistake and not matching design comps)
* 2016-07-13 - Datagrid alternate row colors Changed
* 2016-06-20 - Changed background color of drop down to transparent (to match designs)
* 2016-06-08 - Vertical Tabs - added 3 themes.
* 2016-06-02 - Design of Datagrid Changed to add back the column next to the selection checkboxes.
* 2016-06-02 - Design of radios/checkboxes changed to reduce size.

## 4.1.1 - Patch Release
Release Date: March 18th, 2016

### Key New
* Splitter Control
* File Upload Control
* Empty States Widget Design
* Lightbox

### Breaking Changes
* 2016-03-01 - Input Fields - Changed event in datagrid from rowremove, to removerow to match other events.
* 2016-03-01 - Datagrid Control - Changed event in datagrid from rowremove, to removerow to match other events.
* 2016-02-09 - Mask Control - Due to the change in how the options are defined for the Mask Control, the "pattern" definiton no longer resides on the `data-mask` attribute.  However, the `data-mask` attribute is still necessary in order for _initialize.js_ to properly invoke a mask on an input field.  This attribute has become a boolean as a result.  Providing `data-mask` on an input element creates a mask, and not providing it will do nothing.
* 2016-02-09 - Mask Control - Making the move to normalize this Control against the others by setting things up with a `data-options` attribute instead of unqiue HTML5 `data-*` attributes.  In the next version these will no longer work.  Please update your code accordingly.

### Ui Changes
* 2016-02-16 - Changed Hyperlink, Focus state and colors. Refined all 3 themes.
* 2016-02-16 - Changed Breadcrumb, Focus state and colors. Refined all 3 themes.

## 4.1.0 - Minor  Release
Release Date: 2016-01-26

### Key New
* Bullet Chart
* Datagrid Contextual Toolbar
* Design Changes for V1.2 of Design Specs

### Breaking Changes

* 2016-01-18 - Color Picker: the colors array should get colors in a 10xN grid.
* 2016-01-18 - "hyperlink back" class now requires use of an SVG element.
* 2016-01-18 - breadcrumb-arrow class removed use breadcrumb class for header breadcrumbs
* 2016-01-14 - Tree - requires updates to SVG icons
* 2016-01-11 - Listview - Changed the name of the listview-toolbar class to contextual-toolbar as it is shared with datagrid.
* 2016-01-11 - Listview - Modified the "dataset" property that previously could contain both an array of data, or a string containing a URL.  This has now been separated into two properties:  "dataset", which always represents the array of internal data, and "source", which is the original set of data as an array, an object, or a URL.  This normalizes the API to be similar to other controls that implement "source", and makes interfacing with the Pager control easier.
* 2016-01-11 - Listview - Changed the 'loadApi()' method to 'loadData()', to standardize against datagrid.  Did this to make the interfacing of both controls with the Pager control work better, and to be consistent.
* 2016-01-05 - Dropdown - Changed the name of the openList event to openlist for consistency.
* 2015-12-07 - Dropdown/Menu Button - Changed the size of the view box n the svg element. That needs to be updated when updating the css or dropdown arrows look too small.
* 2015-12-07 - Dropdown/Multiselect, Tabs, Vertical Tabs, Wizard - changed the name of the "activate" event to "activated", to prevent conflicts with the built-in "activate" event in Windows browsers (IE/Edge).  This issue is documented in HFC-3221.
* 2015-12-04 - Contextual Action Panel - The order in which the close/destroy methods previously worked has been changed to flow a bit more nicely.  The order was changed to accomodate HFC-3212, where a bug was discovered that caused Contextual Action Panels to leave behind markup and events from a Modal control.

## 4.0.5 - Patch Release

### Key New
* Accordion Refactoring ([HFC-2886](http://jira/browse/HFC-2886))
* Lookup

### Breaking Changes
* 2015-??-?? Accordion Refactoring - Some markup modifications are necessary to retain compatibility with all Accordion controls.  All current examples of Accordions in this repository have been updated to reflect the new Markup (and by proxy, all Application Menus as well).  Markup Changes include:
 `<div class=".accordion-pane"></div>` elements are no longer nested inside of `<div class=".accordion-header"></div>` elements.  Place the Panes immediately following the Headers.
 All Accordion Headers that can expand and show content or subheaders will now contain a trigger button that performs this action.  In cases where the trigger isn't present, it will be created and placed correctly.  If the Accordion Header is at the top-level, the trigger will look like a "chevron" be placed immediately after the `<a>`.  If it's a sub-header, the trigger will be a (+/-) depending on its current state, and will be placed before the `<a>`.
 SVG elements containing icons are no longer placed inside of `<a>` elements.  Icons sit adjacent to the `<a>` elements either by themselves, or inside of trigger buttons.  The Accordion Control will move these icons to their proper locations automatically if they are found inside of `<a>` links.
 In order to correctly space out content inside an accordion, a new element type, `<div class="accordion-content"></div>` can be used inside accordion panes to separate the content from other accordion headers in a more semantic way.
* Datagrid sorting is now matched up via column id - where as before it was field. Should not cause any major issues as most of the time these values are the same , but this was done so that the same field can be used with different id's


### Ui Changes
* The Accordion Control has been redesigned per a new specification ([HFC-2927](http://jira/browse/HFC-2927)).
